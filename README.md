Real Estate Platform

The Real Estate platform is a comprehensive web application designed to revolutionize the way users find and interact with real estate listings. With a focus on user experience, the platform offers real-time notifications, a user-friendly interface, and a robust admin panel for managing listings.
Project Structure

The project is divided into two main parts:

    Frontend (real_estate_front): Built with React, the frontend provides an interactive user interface for property seekers. It supports functionalities such as user authentication, viewing property listings, and receiving notifications.

    Backend (real_estate_back): Powered by Node.js and Express, the backend handles API requests, database operations, and serves as the backbone for the platform's functionality, including data scraping from external real estate websites.
